A simple game in Unity3d exploring the difficulties of providing a balanced life with other people when you sometimes fail to appreciate other people's point of view. An MA Digital Media Art project

Two people play the game which is projected onto a wall. The wall has a divider down the middle of it, so that each player isn't fully aware of what's going on on the other side of the divide. Both players have a controller. Both can control the same cursor
They each have a job to do - to get some different coloured balls into a cup which is at the bottom of the screen between both of them. 
They need to cooperate accross the divide to get the good balls into the cup and avoid the toxic ones which reduce their score.
